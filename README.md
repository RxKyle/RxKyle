HEY THERE.....!! 
  My Name, Well you can just call me Jett.

- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in mainly HTML coding, But I would REALLY love to learn Java, But I think Kotlin would be A LOT EASIER.... Or so I have heard that is, 
I want to be one of those kinds of hackers that helps people hunt down people who have hacked them, and just be able to recover all of their stolen information, and 
also their accounts, or whatever it may be, And also be able to Locate EXACTLY where the Hacker is, (Not for Physical Hurting Purposes or Threats) , But just so I'd Know ;P 
And I would just also LOVE to be able to just........ Be able to like SCREW with these Hackers and like COMPLETELY TAKE OVER THEM, As they are trying to Hack me, Or somebody else, 
and I end up shutting THEM DOWN...... ETC ETC...... 

- I Am currently learning SLOWLY, INTO JAVA, KOTLIN, CSS, C, C#, C+ , C++, JAVASCRIPT, JSON, GIT ;P , And Python. (Also Sometimes I go Back and practice some more HTML So I don't forget it...... , 
But TBH I DO HAVE A LOTTTTTTTTTTTTT TO LEARN ABOUT HTML YET REALLY, Because even if you have learned mainly even just ALL OF THE BASICS, And more........ ETC ETC, 
there is ALWAYS just more to learn than that.......... BOOTSTRAP 3 & 4 LOOK PRETTY FUN AS WELL.....!!

- üíûÔ∏è I am NOT EXACTLY, Looking to really COLLABERATE, On much of ANYTHING RIGHT NOW, UNLESS.......... YOU ARE WILLING TO HELP AND TEACH ME WITH YOUR OWN GUIDANCE, 
AND WITH YOUR OWN KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM....... I'D LOVE TO LEARN FROM THE BEST, OF THE BEST.....!!
